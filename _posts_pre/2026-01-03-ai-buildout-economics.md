While building AI features into applications, I found myself curious about the bigger economic picture driving this
transformation. BlackRock's 2026 Global Outlook offers a perspective on the scale and constraints of what they call an
unprecedented buildout.

## The Scale: Micro is Macro

The AI infrastructure buildout isn't just another tech trend. Corporate capital spending ambitions range between $5-8
trillion globally through 2030, with most concentrated in the U.S. To put this in perspective, the chart below shows how
the AI transformation compares to previous technological revolutions:

```
Capital deepening contribution to GDP growth vs. transformation length:

Steam (1760-1910):        ~14 points over 150 years
Electricity (1899-1941):   ~2 points over 42 years
ICT (1974-2012):          ~19 points over 38 years
AI (2022-2040):           ~15 points over 18 years (projected)
```

The AI buildout could reach a capital deepening level close to the largest historical transformation in half the time.
The spending is dominated by a handful of companies whose individual capital plans have macro-level impact - hence "
micro is macro."

### Why should software engineers care?

For engineers working at tech companies or companies building on AI infrastructure, these economics matter:

- **Revenue uncertainty**: The total revenues needed to justify $8 trillion in spending require either capturing more
  market share across tech (from 25% to 35% of economy-wide revenues) or achieving a U.S. growth breakout from its 2%
  trend
- **Not on autopilot**: Companies could adjust capex plans if visibility on revenues doesn't materialize or energy
  constraints bite harder than expected
- **Spreading gains**: While current buildout concentrates in large tech, productivity and revenue gains will eventually
  spread across sectors - creating opportunities beyond the current builders

The math is interesting: broker analysts
forecast $1.6 trillion in annual hyperscaler revenue increases through 2030. But delivering a reasonable 9-12% return on the upper end of $
8 trillion investment would require $1.7-2.5 trillion in incremental revenues. The gap suggests either new AI-created
revenue streams will emerge, or spending plans will adjust.

## The Constraints: Energy as the Binding Factor

AI data centers could consume 15-20% of current U.S. electricity demand by 2030. Some estimates suggest as high as 25%.
This creates a stark constraint:

**Physical limits:**

- Power grid backlog for new connections
- Slow permitting processes in the West
- Materials and fossil fuel industry capacity

**China's advantage:**

- Building power generation and transmission at pace
- On-time, on-budget nuclear reactors plus coal, hydro, and renewables
- Driving down domestic solar and battery costs through manufacturing scale

The DeepSeek focus this year highlighted that more energy-efficient compute could partly ease constraints, but the scale
of demand still tests infrastructure limits.

### What this means for infrastructure

Energy constraints point to opportunities where bottlenecks bite hardest:

- Power systems and grid infrastructure
- Critical minerals sourcing
- Permitting reform beneficiaries
- Private capital financing energy projects (as elevated government debt limits public spending)

Companies building AI aren't struggling to get chips - the real constraint is land and energy.

## The Financing: Leveraging Up

Getting over the financing "hump" between front-loaded investment and back-loaded revenues requires leverage. The good
news: corporate leverage starts from a healthy position. The largest cloud spenders have an average debt-to-equity ratio
of 0.54x as of late 2025, pointing to room to lever up.

But this creates a more leveraged financial system when combined with highly indebted governments:

**Implications:**

- Higher credit issuance across public and private markets
- Upward pressure on interest rates (higher cost of capital)
- Financial system vulnerabilities to bond yield spikes
- Policy tensions between managing inflation and debt servicing costs

For engineers, this translates to: the cost of capital for tech projects is rising, and companies will be more selective
about which bets to fund.

## Growth Breakout: Now Conceivable

Here's where it gets interesting. For the first time in 150 years, a growth breakout from the U.S.'s 2% trend is
conceivable. Why?

**Historical context:**
U.S. GDP per capita has stayed remarkably close to a ~2% growth trend since 1870, through steam, electricity, and the
digital revolution. None of these innovations broke the trend.

**Why AI might be different:**
AI isn't just an innovation - it has the potential to **innovate the process of innovation**. If AI begins to generate,
test, and improve new concepts autonomously, the rate of discovery could accelerate, driving breakthroughs in materials,
drugs, and technology.

Leading indicators to watch:

- Surge in new patents per year
- Scientific breakthrough velocity
- Rate of concept-to-deployment timelines

## Connections to Software Engineering

The economics of AI buildout mirror patterns familiar to software engineers:

**Capital-intensive vs. capital-light:**

- Previous tech era: capital-light growth, low upfront costs, fast iteration
- AI era: massive upfront infrastructure, delayed revenue, patient capital required

**Technical debt analogy:**

- Taking on debt now (literally and figuratively) to realize future gains
- Front-loading investment is unavoidable to achieve benefits
- The "refactoring" happens when revenues materialize

**Platform effects:**

- Infrastructure builders may not capture all the value
- Similar to how cloud providers enabled applications they didn't build
- Revenue will spread as AI gains move beyond current tech giants

## Final Thoughts

What started as curiosity about AI economics revealed a transformation pushing multiple limits: physical (energy, land),
financial (leverage, cost of capital), and potentially economic (growth rates). For software engineers, the key insights
are:

The AI theme remains dominant for tech company valuations, but it's not guaranteed. Energy constraints could slow
buildout, creating opportunities in infrastructure. Private credit and active investing will matter more as dispersion
increases between winners and losers.

Whether you're choosing which company to join, deciding which technologies to bet on, or understanding why your
organization's capital allocation is shifting, these economics provide context. The buildout continues, but it's
navigating real constraints - and that's where the next opportunities emerge.
