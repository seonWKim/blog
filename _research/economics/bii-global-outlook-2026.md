### Pages 4-5: Investment Environment

**The Chart (Page 4):** AI transformation is unfolding faster than steam, electricity, or ICT

**Why it matters:**

### Page 6: Theme 1 - "Micro is Macro"

**The Concept:** A handful of companies (Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) are spending so much on AI that it affects the entire economy.

**The Gap:** There's a gap between revenues needed ($1.7-2.5T) vs. what analysts forecast ($1.6T)

**The Question:** Will tech companies capture enough revenue to justify the spending, or will it spread across the economy?

**My analysis:**

**Winners and losers I'm thinking about:**

---

### Page 7: Theme 2 - "Leveraging Up"

**The Concept:** Companies need to borrow NOW to build AI infrastructure, but profits come LATER

**The Chart:** Government debt is at post-war highs, but corporate debt is relatively low

**The Risk:** More leveraged financial system = vulnerable to shocks (bond yield spikes)

**My thoughts on this financing "hump":**

**Risks I'm concerned about:**

### Page 8: Theme 3 - "Diversification Mirage"

**The Concept:** Trying to diversify away from AI concentration is actually a big active bet against the dominant trend

**The Data:** Equal-weighted S&P 500 is up 3% vs. 11% for market-cap weighted in 2025

**The Implication:** Need a "Plan B" and readiness to pivot quickly

### Page 9: AI Buildout Faces Constraints

**The Bottleneck:** Energy - AI data centers could use 15-20% of current U.S. electricity by 2030

**The Chart:** Huge gap between demand-based forecasts and supply-based forecasts

**China's Advantage:** Building power generation faster (nuclear, coal, hydro, renewables)

**DeepSeek Insight:** More energy-efficient models could ease constraints

### Page 10: Fragmentation - AI and Defense

**The Shift:** Third world order since WWII - U.S. resetting economic/geopolitical relationships

**U.S.-China Rivalry:** Competition over AI, trade, technology, energy, defense

**Europe's Response:** NATO targeting 5% GDP defense spending by 2035; Germany suspended "debt brake"

**My thoughts on geopolitical fragmentation:**

**How this affects investment decisions:**

### Page 11: Future of Finance - Stablecoins

**The Trend:** Stablecoins (digital dollars) evolving from crypto tool to bridge with traditional finance

**Market Size:** Over $250 billion as of Nov 2025

**The 2025 Genius Act:** First U.S. regulatory framework for stablecoins

**The Risk:** Could compete with bank deposits and money market funds if scaled

**My understanding of stablecoins:**

### Page 12: Private Credit Enters New Phase

**The Shift:** After years of growth, now entering "more uneven phase"

**The Dispersion:** Covenant defaults much higher for smaller borrowers (<$10M) vs. larger ones

**The Shakeout:** Poorly structured deals will unwind; disciplined lenders will be distinguished

**Key Takeaway:** Manager selection and due diligence are CRITICAL

### Page 13: Infrastructure - A Timely Moment

**The Concept:** Infrastructure sits at intersection of structural demand and market opportunity

**The Valuation:** Listed infrastructure trading at deep discount (below GFC and COVID levels)

**Why It's Safe:** Infrastructure is indispensable regardless of which AI companies win

**Types:** Transport, energy, digital, utility systems with regulated/contracted cash flows

### Page 14: Room to Run for EM

**The Shift:** Moving from local-currency EM bonds to hard-currency EM debt

**The Quality Upgrade:** High-yield EM bonds driving most rating upgrades in 2025

**Strategic View:** India stands out for long-term (demographics, digitization, geopolitical positioning)

**My thoughts on EM opportunities:**

#### Strategic (5+ years)
