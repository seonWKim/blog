## Long-Term Investor Success Framework

**Core Principles:**
1. **Probabilistic advantage**: Bet where statistical odds favor success
2. **Capital management**: Maintain sufficient funds to enable repeated trials
3. **Rule-based discipline**: Follow systematic rules to control behavior

**Key Insight:** As the number of repeated trials increases, outcomes converge toward expected probability (Law of Large Numbers)

## Portfolio Diversification

**Diversification Fundamentals:**
- Investing in assets with similar correlation coefficients is NOT true diversification
- Investing in assets with different correlation coefficients reduces risk
- Optimal allocation based on risk tolerance requires:
  - Expected return rates
  - Volatility metrics
  - Correlation coefficients
  - Factor models (note: this data is expensive)

**Market Dynamics:**
- Must capture changing market conditions
- Example: Stock-bond correlation can shift from positive → negative → positive over time

## Asset Allocation Mastery

**Required Knowledge:**
1. **Macro variables understanding:**
   - Economic growth
   - Inflation
   - Interest rates

2. **Asset class behavior:** Study how different asset classes respond to macro variable changes

3. **Economic cycle patterns:** Study historical economic cycles through economic history

4. **Price action:** Do I understand why the chart shows this price trend?
   - Write explanation in your own words
   - Review earnings calls → Check sharp questions analysts asked the CEO

## Investment Decision Framework

**Three-Stage Process:**

1. **Hypothesis (가설):** Develop investment insights and identify opportunities

2. **Analysis (분석):** Calculate appropriate stock valuation

   **B. Intrinsic Valuation (내재 가치 평가):**
   - DDM (Dividend Discount Model)
