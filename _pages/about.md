## Hi, I'm Seon Woo Kim

I'm a software engineer with professional experience building user-facing business applications in the fintech industry. I focus on delivering reliable, scalable solutions that directly impact customers and business operations.

### What I Do

My primary work involves:
- **Business Application Development**: Building production systems for fintech applications, focusing on user experience, reliability, and business logic
- **Software Engineering**: Writing clean, maintainable code and designing systems that solve real business problems

### Expanding My Expertise

I'm actively learning and expanding my skills into areas beyond my current experience:
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Exploring cloud-native systems, Kubernetes, container orchestration, and performance tuning
- **AI/ML Systems**: Learning about AI applications and their integration into production environments
- **System Fundamentals**: Studying hardware and low-level systems topics like NUMA architecture, CPU scheduling, and memory management

This blog serves as my learning journal where I document these explorations and share insights as I broaden my technical knowledge.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy documenting my learnings and sharing them with the developer community. I write about technical challenges, system design patterns, and lessons learned from building software.
