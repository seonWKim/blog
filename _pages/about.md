## Hi, I'm Seon Woo Kim 👋

I'm a software engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable systems. My work focuses on infrastructure, distributed systems, and AI applications in production environments.

### What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud-native systems, with hands-on experience in Kubernetes, container orchestration, and performance tuning
- **System Architecture**: Building distributed systems with focus on reliability, scalability, and observability
- **AI Systems**: Developing and deploying AI/ML applications in production, bridging the gap between research and real-world systems

### Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into the fundamentals of physical and virtual systems—exploring topics like NUMA architecture, CPU scheduling, and memory management to build more performant applications. I believe understanding the hardware layer is crucial for writing efficient software.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy documenting my learnings and sharing insights with the developer community. I write about production failures, system design patterns, and infrastructure challenges I encounter while building software.
